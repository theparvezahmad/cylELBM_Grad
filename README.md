Numerical modeling of flow around a fixed circular cylinder employing the entropic
lattice Boltzmann method with Grad's approximation.
Entropic LBM is improved version of classic LBM.
Boltzmannâ€™s H-theorem is enforced.
Better accuracy and unconditional stability.
Test case: Flow around a fixed circular cylinder.
